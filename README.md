# Music App-Flask

Music App is a platform to manage, share and stream music. User can register and login into the application to upload, download, delete, play and search songs. 

## Getting Started

### Technologies

```
Python 3.7.3
Flask 1.0.2
Sqlite 3.27.2
```

### Packages

```
flask
flask_login
flask_sqlalchemy
flask_bcrypt
wtforms
flask_wtf
flask_limiter
```

### Installation and Setup

To install the above packages use:
```
sudo pip install â€“r requirements.txt
```
Database file is already uploaded in the repo. To create your own db, navigate to app.py from the terminal and use the python interpreter:
```
from app import db
db.create_all()
```
A secret key is present in the config.py file. Create your own using the python interpreter and replace the existing secret key:
```
import os
print(os.urandom(16))
```


## Running the app
